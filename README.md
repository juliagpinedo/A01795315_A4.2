2. **convert_numbers.py:** A tool for converting decimal numbers into binary and hexadecimal representations.
3. **word_count.py:** A tool to count the occurrences of specific words in a given text file.

#### Folder structure
This repository contains a folder structure to organize the results (*on a txt file*) for each of the Test Cases applied for each of the programs. This is to ensure easy access and reference to the outcomes of different executions.

Additionally, a video has been included. This video demonstrates the execution of each program and provides a detailed explanation of the logic behind their implementation.
